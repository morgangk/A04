## Assignment A04

Creating a client side web application that makes use of two or more 3rd party APIs.

## HTML and JavaScript

Using a HTML file to create/organize the contents being used on the webpage. Also used Javascript in the HTML file to include the code that fetched the information from the APIs and displayed the information that is in response to the APIs. Input boxes we inluded for the users to input values to be able to get the APIs to respond and for the information to render.

## CSS

Created a CSS file to style the different contents of the webpage based on the different tags and ids.

## APIs that Were Used

The first API used was the Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API, where you can input different values for latitude and longitude and would be able to see the different temperatures in Celcius assiociated with their times hourly. The Weather Forecast API also allows access to the hourly humidity, rain, snow depth, cloud cover, wind speed, etc. But we mainly focus on the temperature.

The second API used was a Cat Fact API where you could either draw information about a singular cat fact, multiple pages of cat facts, or receiving a list of cat breeds. Specifically here, we are obtaining cat facts from any of the pages presented. Therefore, the user just needs to type in a page number between 1-34 that they wish to see the different cat facts on that current page. They can always change what page they want to look at and the same facts will never repeat right after each other. 

Therefore, my application includes a display of a weather forecast and a random cat fact generator.
